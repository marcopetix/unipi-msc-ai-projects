## ðŸŽ“ Thesis

**Title:** Behavior-Aware Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning with Ï€-PACT

**Final Grade:** 110/110 cum laude

This thesis explores behavior-aware transfer learning in reinforcement learning, focusing on a novel framework called **Ï€-PACT** (Ï€-vectors-based Policy Adaptation by Characterization and Transfer).

Ï€-PACT employs **policy supervectors** (Ï€-vectors), compact representations of policy behavior, to characterize and compare skills across different tasks. These Ï€-vectors are obtained by adapting a Universal Background Model (UBM) to the state features observed during policy execution.

The framework dynamically monitors a target policyâ€™s learning process and uses supervector distances to:
- Identify **challenging situations**
- Trigger **knowledge transfer** from relevant source policies

### ðŸ”¬ Evaluation

The approach was evaluated in the `highway-env` suite, analyzing:
- The representational properties of the Ï€-vectors  
- The effectiveness of the transfer mechanism

The results highlight the **potential of behavior-aware transfer learning**, while also revealing key challenges and limitations to be addressed in future work.
