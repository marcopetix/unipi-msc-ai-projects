### 📄 Final Project: The Evolution of Feudal Reinforcement Learning

- **Goal:**  
  Provide an in-depth comparative study of three key papers on hierarchical reinforcement learning based on feudal architectures.

- **Papers reviewed:**  
  - [Feudal Reinforcement Learning (Dayan & Hinton, 1993)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1992/file/d14220ee66aeec73c49038385428ec4c-Paper.pdf)  
  - [FeUdal Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Vezhnevets et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01161)  
  - [Feudal Multi-Agent Hierarchies for Cooperative Reinforcement Learning (Ahilan & Dayan, 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08492)

- **Main topics covered:**  
  ✅ Strict hierarchical architectures (manager/worker roles)  
  ✅ Recursive reinforcement with intrinsic and extrinsic rewards  
  ✅ Reward and information hiding for subgoal learning  
  ✅ Temporal abstraction and multi-timescale learning  
  ✅ Decentralized multi-agent coordination through hierarchical goals

- **Key findings and analysis:**  
  - Explained key architectural innovations (e.g., dilated LSTM manager, directional goals)  
  - Discussed benchmark results on complex tasks like Atari games, maze navigation, and cooperative multi-agent settings  
  - Analyzed trade-offs between hierarchical vs. flat policies and intrinsic vs. extrinsic reward structures  
  - Highlighted challenges like non-stationarity, scalability, and coordination in multi-agent setups

- **My contributions:**  
  Prepared a written report and oral presentation summarizing the architectures, experiments, results, design choices, and open challenges across the three papers.
