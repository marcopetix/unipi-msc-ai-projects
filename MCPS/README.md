## 📱 Mobile and Cyber-Physical Systems (University of Pisa, 22/06/2020)

This folder contains my final project for the *Mobile and Cyber-Physical Systems* course at the University of Pisa.  
The project is a smart waste management system combining IoT sensors, a backend system, and user interaction with gamification features.

### 📄 Final Project: SmartBin — A Smart Waste Management System

- **Goal:**  
  Design and prototype a smart bin system that monitors waste bin levels, tracks user interactions, and rewards recycling behavior through a gamified interface.

- **System components:**  
  ✅ **Backend web application:** Flask-based Python app with Google Maps integration, displaying bin locations, fill levels, and user interaction stats  
  ✅ **Database:** MySQL backend storing user, bin, and interaction data (`smartbin.sql`)  
  ✅ **Frontend:** HTML templates for maps, dashboards, and user interaction visualizations  
  ✅ **IoT integration (simulated):** Code and database logic to simulate bin capacity updates and user-card interactions

### 🛠️ Key features

- Real-time bin monitoring and visualization on map (Google Maps API)  
- User interaction tracking and waste disposal logging  
- Gamification system calculating user points based on sorted vs. unsorted waste  
- Admin and user dashboards with capacity and interaction statistics  
- Database triggers for auto-updating user points on waste events
