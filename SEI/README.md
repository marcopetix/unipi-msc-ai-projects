## üåê Social and Ethical Issues in Information Technology (University of Pisa, 04/08/2020)

This folder contains the final essays and presentation I completed for the *Social and Ethical Issues in Information Technology* course at the University of Pisa.  
The course explored key ethical and societal questions raised by computing and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on anthropomorphism in human-robot interaction.

### üìÑ Final Works

- **Sustainable Anthropomorphism for the Improvement of Social Robotics**  
  A scientific essay exploring the psychological, social, and ethical challenges of anthropomorphic design in social robotics.  
  It analyzes the risks of emotional dependence, deception, and manipulation, while proposing strategies to mitigate user misconceptions through improved design and social connection reinforcement.

- **Self-delusion and (the conscious exploitment of) Anthropomorphism**  
  A critical presentation discussing how anthropomorphism can be used intentionally and ethically in human-robot interaction.  
  It examines ethical frameworks (deontological vs. consequentialist), argues for conscious user participation in the illusion, and raises open questions about sustainability, safety, and social impact.

- **Damning a Machine‚Äôs Soul**  
  A short essay exploring the applicability of human punishment frameworks (incarceration, fines, rehabilitation) to artificial agents.  
  It questions responsibility attribution between users, developers, and deployers, and reflects on the limits of applying human-centric justice concepts to machine behavior.
