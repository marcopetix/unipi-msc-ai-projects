### 📄 Final Project: Control Strategies for Soft Robotic Manipulators

- **Goal:**  
  Provide a structured overview and comparative analysis of 34 control strategies for soft robotic manipulators, based on the survey paper [*Control Strategies for Soft Robotic Manipulators: A Survey*](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/soro.2017.0007).

- **Main topics covered:**  
  ✅ Modeling approaches: model-based, model-free, hybrid  
  ✅ Design aspects: actuation types, manipulator details  
  ✅ Control strategies: static and dynamic controllers  
  ✅ Challenges: underactuation, compliance, disturbances, sensory feedback requirements

- **Key points from the presentation:**  
  - Constant Curvature (CC) approximation models  
  - Neural network-based inverse kinematics and dynamics  
  - Hybrid approaches combining analytical and learned components  
  - Dynamic controllers: trajectory optimization, feedback linearization  
  - Open research directions in soft robotics control

- **My contributions:**  
  Prepared a detailed presentation summarizing key control strategies, categorized approaches, and highlighted strengths, limitations, and open challenges in the field.
