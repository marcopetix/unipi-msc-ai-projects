# ðŸ“„ Midterm 3: Adversarial Attacks and Training on CIFAR-10 CNNs

- **Goal:** Evaluate and improve CNN robustness under adversarial attacks.
- **Approach:**  
  âœ… Trained CNN with Keras, reaching 86% accuracy  
  âœ… Attacks: FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner (CleverHans)  
  âœ… Adversarial training with fixed/random Îµ

- **Key insights:**  
  - Showed selective resistance to attacks; discussed robustnessâ€“accuracy tradeoffs and transferability.
