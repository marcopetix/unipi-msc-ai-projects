# ðŸ“„ Midterm 2: Image Understanding with LDA and Bag of Visual Words

- **Goal:** Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to Bag of Visual Words representations for unsupervised image understanding.
- **Approach:**  
  âœ… SIFT descriptors on MSER keypoints  
  âœ… Grid-based DAISY descriptors  
  âœ… LDA topic modeling to extract latent categories

- **Key insights:**  
  - Sparse sampling focused on informative regions, grid sampling covered global context.  
  - Proposed adaptive sampling to combine benefits.
