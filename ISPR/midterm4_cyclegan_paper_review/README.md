# ðŸ“„ Midterm 4: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with CycleGAN

- **Goal:** Review [Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).
- **Content:**  
  âœ… Adversarial + cycle-consistency losses  
  âœ… Generator: ResNet blocks; Discriminator: PatchGAN  
  âœ… Applications: object transfiguration, season/style transfer

- **Key results:**  
  - Compared performance on Cityscapes with BiGAN, CoGAN, SimGAN, pix2pix  
  - Discussed limitations and extensions toward multimodal translation
